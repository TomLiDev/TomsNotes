      <h2>Python Testing</h2>
      <p>
        Similar in many ways to JavaScript Testing, although there are some
        differences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Popular Testing Frameworks for Python - Unittest, PyTest, Robot, DocTest
        and Testify.
      </p>
      <p>
        Focus on Unittest, part of the standard Python library. Django also uses
        Unittest as its testing framework.
      </p>
      <p>This kind of automated testing is key part of DevOps</p>
      <p>
        Red - Green - Refactor cycle. Red part is writing a test that will fail.
        Green is writing bare minimum to pass the test. Once code passes the
        test refactoring can take place to make the code more efficient.
      </p>
      <p>Test Suite - A group of testing cases that fit in a group together.</p>
      <p>
        Test Fixture - Test fixtures are to ensure there is a well-known and
        fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable.
        E.g. loading a database with a known set of data, copying files etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        For Unittest, test files must begin with the word test, e.g
        test_value.py. Methods within test files must also begin with test_
        otherwise it will be ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        import unittest - Single line required at top of test file, does not
        require a pip3 install command as Unittest is part of the standard
        Python libary.
      </p>
      <p>
        class SomeClass(unittest.TestCase): - This is how a test must start to
        make use of Unittest functionality, in this the unittest.TestCase bit is
        passing Unittest functionality into the testing class.
      </p>
      <p>
        assert - Method that can be called in this testing on a particular
        instance of a class to check for values e.g. - assertEqual - would look
        for the result of a certain method to see if it equalled something.
      </p>
      <p>
        setUp - Unittest method for building/setting things up temporarily for
        testing purposes. Is run before each test individually.
      </p>
      <p>
        tearDown - Opposite of setUp, destroys/removes temporary
        files/folders/connection to DB's etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        setUpClass - Similar to setUp but only run once at very beginning before
        all tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        tearDownClass - Similar to above but will tear down/destroy things once
        at the end, after all other tests have been run.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mocking - Creating scenarios for testing things beyond the immediate
        code. E.g. mocking connection to an external API.
      </p>
      <p>
        from unittest.mock import patch - import line required at top of test
        file to do mocking stuff.
