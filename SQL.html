      <h2>SQL/Sequel</h2>
      <p>
        Postgre SQL -'Postgres' - Popular relational database. Free, popular.
        Used as primary database for many web and mobile applications. Postgress
        is an object-relational DB, MySQL is a standard relational DB, so
        Postgress includes things like table inheritance. Postgress also more
        closely alligned to SQL standards when it comes to case sensitivity,
        making capitlisation more specific, also supported across multiple
        languages unlike MySQL. Basically more popular and better than MySQL.
      </p>
      <h3>Chinook</h3>
      <p>
        Chinook is a sample DB, freely available, can be used with most
        relational DB's. Link
        https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/blob/master/ChinookDatabase/DataSources/Chinook_PostgreSql.sql
      </p>
      <p>
        Terminal command - psql - this and only this into terminal will 'enter
        DB mode' the Postgres CLI command line interface
      </p>
      <p>Terminal command - \l - List all DB's (must be in CLI)</p>
      <p>
        in terminal commands - \c database - In this example you will connect to
        whatever database name is provided
      </p>
      <p>
        Terminal command - CREATE DATABASE databasename; - This will create a
        database of whatever name is given as databasename, must have semicolon
        to close
      </p>
      <p>
        Termial command - \i localdatabasename_PostgreSql.sql - This example
        would install/initialise the PostgreSql.sql standard sample into DB of
        localdatabasename
      </p>
      <p>
        Terminal command - \q - Will quit Postgres and return to normal terminal
      </p>
      <p>
        Terminal command - q - Just q by itself exits the current query, not the
        CLI
      </p>
      <p>
        Terminal command - SELECT * FROM "Something"; - This command doesn't
        need capitals but this is standard practice to identify the different
        pieces of the query, asterisk means select all. - SELECT "Artist" WHERE
        "Name" = 'Oasis'; - This command would find Artists that are Named
        Oasis, actual value to be searched for in this case must in single
        quotes. This is to distinguish between "Column Names" and 'Value'.
      </p>
      <h3>psycopg2</h3>
      <p>
        PsycoPG2 is a very popular library for connecting Python to Postgres,
        including Django. Essentially an adapter to allow python functions on
        Postgres DB.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terminal command - pip3 install psycopg2 - Will install psycopg2 library
        into project.
      </p>
      <h3>ORM</h3>
      <p>
        ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping. Essentially a way to query
        data in a database through the use of objects. Object - The object that
        you are using from the programming language. Most popular ORM libraries
        are Djamgo and SQL Alchemy. SQL Alchemy particularly good as it is
        agnostic and facilitates cleaner code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Terminal command - pip3 install SQLAlchemy - pip3 install
        sqlalchemy==1.4.46 -
      </p>
      <p>
        Expression Language - middle layer of SQL Alchemy abstraction. Allows
        for looser use of grammer and double quotes etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Class/Method Based Models - The most 'Pythonic' method and the highest
        level of abstraction. Each class/method should only do one thing.
