      <h2>Frameworks</h2>
      <p>
        Frameworks are intended to reduce the repetition and boredom from
        coding. A framework is a resuable 'semi-complete' application that can
        be speciliazed to produce custom applications. A lot of the 'plumbing'
        in the code can be hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pre-defined code and template to allow new coders to quickly build world
        class applications. Built by some of the best developers in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        KIS - Keep it simple. YAGNI - You aren't going to need it. DRY - Don't
        repeat yourself. YAGNI - Don't try and anticipate the future, don't try
        and build functionality which isn't immediatly useful/needed. You
        probably won't need the further functionality. Do the simplest thing
        possible that will work.
