      <h2>Frameworks</h2>
      <p>
        Frameworks are intended to reduce the repetition and boredom from
        coding. A framework is a resuable 'semi-complete' application that can
        be speciliazed to produce custom applications. A lot of the 'plumbing'
        in the code can be hidden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pre-defined code and template to allow new coders to quickly build world
        class applications. Built by some of the best developers in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        KIS - Keep it simple. YAGNI - You aren't going to need it. DRY - Don't
        repeat yourself. YAGNI - Don't try and anticipate the future, don't try
        and build functionality which isn't immediatly useful/needed. You
        probably won't need the further functionality. Do the simplest thing
        possible that will work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Separation of Concerns - Split functions, variables etc into individual,
        resuable chunks of code that do one thing. There should be no
        repetition. Splitting processes/functions down allows code to be
        completed more easliy and the project completion.
      </p>
      <p>
        MVC - Model, View and Controller. An architectural programming pattern,
        a way of thinking about processing information and structuring an
        application. Utilised by most frameworks. Seperate data management and
        data presentation. Breaking down processes/functions as far as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Model - Represents the data being worked with. Model code often
        retrieves/adds data held in a DB or other structure, or via another
        service such as an API. Generally wouldn't be 'seen'. Talks to the
        Controller, not the View.
      </p>
      <p>
        View - Display the user interface. Often built as templates to hold
        information provided by the Controller.
      </p>
      <p>
        Controller - Code that does thinking and decision, handles user
        interaction and provides 'behaviour'. Never talks to a DB directly.
        Never talks to the screen direclty, only the View. E.g. a GET request,
        prompted by someone clicking on the website, would be processed via the
        Controller.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frameworks can be considered Full or Micro, depending on the number of pre-installed components
